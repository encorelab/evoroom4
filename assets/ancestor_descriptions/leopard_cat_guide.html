The leopard cat is a small species of the wild cats that have a spotted pattern similar to one of a leopard, hence the name leopard cat. A leopard cat is roughly the same size as a normal household cat. Despite its small size, it has few predators. While they donâ€™t swim often, leopard cats have webbing between their toes allowing them to swim better and also it helps keep their balance on slippery riverbanks. These cats are solitary and nocturnal. While the leopard cat is not endangered as much as some other animals, their populations are declining, mostly due to habitat loss.
