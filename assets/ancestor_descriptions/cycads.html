Cycads are an ancient group of seed plants with a crown of large compound leaves and a stout trunk. They are a minor component of the flora in tropical and subtropical regions today, but during the Jurassic Period, they were a common sight in many parts of the world. For this reason, the Jurassic is often referred to as the "Age of Cycads". Today only a handful of cycads still exist, and many are facing possible extinction in the wild (such as Microcycas in western Cuba). They are scattered around the globe but are restricted to tropical or subtropical climates.
