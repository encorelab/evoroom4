Dryopithecus was a <span class="guide-text">genus of apes</span> that is known from Eastern Africa into Eurasia during the late Miocene period. Apes apparently evolved from monkeys early in the Miocene epoch. Dryopithecus was about 60 centimetres (24 in) in body length, and more closely resembled a monkey than a modern ape. The structure of its limbs and wrists show that it walked in a similar way to modern chimpanzees, but that it used the flat of its hands, like a monkey, rather than knuckle-walking, like modern apes. Its face exhibited klinorhynchy, with its face being tilted downwards in profile.  It likely spent most of its life in trees, and was probably a brachiator, similar to modern orangutans and gibbons. Its molars had relatively little enamel, suggesting that it ate soft leaves and fruit, an ideal food for a tree-dwelling animal.
