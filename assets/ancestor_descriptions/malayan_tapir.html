The Malayan tapir looks similar to a pig with its thick skin and snout. However its closest relative are the horse and rhinoceros. It lives in dense rainforests or swamps, where there is lush vegetation. The front half of their body and hind legs are black, while the rear above the legs are white. This white-black pattern allows it to become almost invisible in its habitat. Newborns have a reddish-brown coat with white and yellow spots and stripes that allow them to camouflage with bamboo or jungle reeds. However when they are around 8 months old, their pattern begins to fade and have a normal adult coat colouring. They are solitary animals with a strong sense of smell. While they may appear slow and easy to catch, tapirs actually have recessed eyes, and short ears, tail, and legs with a stocky body, allowing them to race through a forest due to their compact shape. Tapirs are also good at swimming and diving, and will seek refuge in waterways where they can stay underwater for several minutes.
