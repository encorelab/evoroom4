Traditionally the Viverravidae (viverravids) had been thought to be the earliest carnivorans with fossil records first appearing in the Paleocene of North America about 60 million years ago. Viverrids are amongst the primitive families of the Carnivora, with skeletons very similar to those of fossils dating back to the Eocene, up to 50 million years ago. They are variable in form, but generally resemble long-nosed cats. Most have retractile or partially-retractile claws, a baculum, and an anal scent gland. Viverrids range in size from the African Linsang with a body length of 33 cm (13 in), and a weight of 650 g (1.4 lb), to the African Civet at 84 cm (33 in) and 18 kg (40 lb), although very large Binturongs, to 25 kg (55 lb), attain the greatest mass.  They are nocturnal animals, with excellent hearing and vision. They are generally solitary. Despite their placement in the order Carnivora, they are omnivorous, or, in the case of the Palm Civets, almost entirely herbivorous.
