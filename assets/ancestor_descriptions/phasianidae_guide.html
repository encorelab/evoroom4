The Phasianidae is a family of birds which consists of the <span class="guide-text">pheasants</span> and partridges, including the junglefowl (including chicken), Old World Quail, francolins, monals and peafowl. The family is a large one, and is occasionally broken up into two subfamilies, the Phasianinae, and the Perdicinae. Sometimes additional families and birds are treated as being in this family as well; the American Ornithologists' Union includes Tetraonidae (the grouse), Numididae (guineafowls), and Meleagrididae (turkeys) in Phasianidae as subfamilies.  The earliest fossil records of phasianids date to the late Oligocene epoch, about 30 million years ago.
