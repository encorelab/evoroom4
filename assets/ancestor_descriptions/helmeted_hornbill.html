Rhinoplax vigil, the helmeted hornbill, is a territorial species bird from the order of Coraciiformes. These birds are about one metre long (excluding half-metre tail) and weight around 3 kilograms, with the males heavier. Their diet comprises mostly of figs and other fruits, and sometimes wood-dwelling insects. The bird inhabits Borneo, Sumatra, Malyasia, and some philippine islands. It prefers rugged and hilly terrain, and lives in tropically forested areas up to 1500 metres above sea level. Not only is this species losing habitat because of deforestation, it is also hunted for the casque above its beak, making it almost endangered.
