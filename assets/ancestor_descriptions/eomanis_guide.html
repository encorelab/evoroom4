Eomanis ("primitive ghost") is the <span class="guide-text">earliest known true (and scaled) pangolin</span> from the Middle Eocene of Europe. Fossils collected from the Messel Pit, Germany, indicate that this 50 cm long animal was rather similar to living pangolins. However, unlike modern pangolins, its tail and legs did not bear scales. According to the stomach contents of the excellently preserved Messel specimens, Eomanisâ€™ diet consisted of both insects and plants. Its contemporary was the related, albeit scale-less, anteater-like Eurotamandua.
