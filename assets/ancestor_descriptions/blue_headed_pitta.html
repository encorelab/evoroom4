Pitta baudii are birds in the phylum Passeriformes that live in the lowland rainforest of Borneo. Their diet consists mainly of insects and other small animals - ants, beetles, worms, crickets, and caterpillars have all been found in specimens of this species. They are most sexually active during June and July. They prefer to live in forest near rivers, and sometimes live in logged forest, but they stay away from clearings. Because these areas are often subject to slash and burn deforestation or logging, the bird is endangered and losing habitat.
