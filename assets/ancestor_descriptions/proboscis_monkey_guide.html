The proboscis monkey is another endangered moneky living in Borneo.  It weighs up to 50 pounds and is 24 to 28 inches tall.  They are omnivores eating meat and seeds and leaves but the only fruits they will eat are unripe because the sugar in ripe fruits can ferment in their stomach and lead to fatal bloating.  They live in wet areas near coasts or rivers and are proficient swimmers.  They tend to not stray far from where they've established a home.
