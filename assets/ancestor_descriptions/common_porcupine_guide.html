In Latin, porcupine means quill pig, and true to its name, its coat has sharp quills to scare off predators. While their hair is soft, quills are mixed with their hair on the back, sides, and tail. Unless threatened, these quills usually life flat. Contrary to popular belief, porcupines cannot shoot their quills, but they do come off easily when touched. These quills are difficult to remove once embedded into skin, as they have sharp tips or barbs.
