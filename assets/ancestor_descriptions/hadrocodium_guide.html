The recent discovery of this 195 million year old fossil has added another member to the <span class="guide-text">early mammal</span> family during this time period. Hadrocodium weighed only two grams and grew to a length of 32 millimetres. It has the large grain and middle ear of modern mammals, traits that suggest these two features may have evolved together.
