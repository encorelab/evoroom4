Pterosaurs are extinct flying reptiles. Pterosaurs are not dinosaurs (or birds for that matter), but close relatives of them. They lived worldwide in all kinds of environments and ranged from around 50 cm to 13 m in wingspan. They existed from about 225 to 65 million years ago and thus ran alongside the dinosaurs pretty much toe to toe for their entire existence, dying out in the great extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. Although they first appeared in the Triassic period, their origins might extend beyond that by some margin, but fossils of this time are rare, so it is hard to say.

Ranging from the size of a sparrow to the size of an airplane, the pterosaurs (Greek for "wing lizards") ruled the skies in the Jurassic and Cretaceous, and included the largest vertebrate ever known to fly: the late Cretaceous Quetzalcoatlus. The appearance of flight in pterosaurs was separate from the evolution of flight in birds and bats; pterosaurs are not closely related to either birds or bats, and thus provide a classic example of convergent evolution.

it is now thought that all but the largest pterosaurs could sustain powered flight (i.e. actively gain height when they wanted to on their own power and take off from the ground). They had a large wing membrane stretched from an elongate finger on their hand that connected to their body. Accessory membranes were present in the crux of the arm and between the legs.
