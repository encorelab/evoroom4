About two million years ago, the clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa) appeared, and the big cats evolved in increasingly larger sizes to hunt increasingly larger prey. Most of the big cats were very successful at establishing their colonies. In the Old World, the leopards were quite widespread, while in the New World, the jaguar managed to colonize most of the forested areas in the Americas except in the far north, thus competing with the deer-sized prey with the puma.
