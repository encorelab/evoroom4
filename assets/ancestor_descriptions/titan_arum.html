The titan arum (or Amorphophallus titanum) is a large tropical plant that is found in the rainforests of Indonesia, mainly the island of Sumatra.   It is notable for its massive inflorescence, which can be over 3 metres tall.  It also produces the smell of rotting meat to attract carrion eating insects to pollinate it.  It is known locally as a carrion flower.
