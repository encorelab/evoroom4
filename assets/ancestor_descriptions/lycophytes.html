The lycophytes are a small and inconspicuous group of plants today, but in the Carboniferous some lycophytes were forest-forming trees more than 35 meters tall. Lycophytes are the oldest extant group of vascular plants, and dominated major habitats for 40 million years. Plants with true leaves, roots and stems. Leaves are, without exception, microphylls and this is a defining feature of the group (hence, the alternate name for the phylum - the Microphyllophyta). Microphylls have only one vein and are not associated with a leaf gap. They are thought not to be homologous to macrophylls found in ferns and all the groups of seed plants. Roots are adventitious. Branching in both shoot and root occurs by the division of the apical meristem into two parts which can either be equal or with one subordinate and one superior branch. Living members are all herbaceous although Isoetes has secondary growth. Extinct members include tree-like plants which were a prominent part of the Carboniferous swamp-forests and are well represented in the fossil record. They are non-seed plants which are either homosporous with exosporic gametophytes or heterosporous with endosporic gametophytes.
