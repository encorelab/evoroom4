Cycads are an <span class="guide-text">ancient group of seed plants with a crown of large compound leaves and a stout trunk</span>. They are a minor component of the flora in tropical and subtropical regions today, but during the Jurassic Period, they were a common sight in many parts of the world. For this reason, the Jurassic is often referred to as the "Age of Cycads". <span class="guide-text">Today only a handful of cycads still exist</span>, and many are facing possible extinction in the wild (such as Microcycas in western Cuba). They are scattered around the globe but are restricted to tropical or subtropical climates.
