<span class="guide-text">Araucariaceae is a family of evergreen trees</span> that are usually 60 or more meters. The Araucariaceae are monoecious or dioecious trees comprising two genera and about 30 species of the Southern Hemisphere. The leaves are opposite or spirally arranged and are needlelike to broad. The male or microsporangiate strobili are axillary or terminal, comprising many spirally arranged microsporophylls, each bearing 5-20 linear, pendant microsporangia on the lower surface. The pollen grains lack wings.
The female or megasporangiate strobili are generally large and somewhat woody, with numerous spirally disposed ovuliferous scales, each fused with its bract and bearing a single median ovule on the upper surface.
