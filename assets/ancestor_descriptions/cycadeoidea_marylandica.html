Cycadeoidea marylandica is an extinct plant that looks like modern cycads. It dates to the Cretaceous period, 105 million years ago.  Cycads are an ancient group of seed plants with a crown of large compound leaves and a stout trunk. They are a minor component of the flora in tropical and subtropical regions today, but during the Jurassic Period, they were a common sight in many parts of the world. For this reason, the Jurassic is often referred to as the "Age of Cycads."
