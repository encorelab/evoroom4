Ocyceros griseus, the malabar grey hornbill, is medium sized for a hornbill, with a half metre long body, excluding the tail, and lacks the caque above the beak found on most other hornbill species. It Prefers to live in small groups where there is heavy tree cover and it eats mainly fruits, making it very important for seed dispersal. Their breeding season occurs during the first half of the year and unable do dig holes themselves, they make their nests in holes that have already been carved out of trees. Though the population is decreasing, this species is classifed as least concern because of its large range - the entire west coast of India.
