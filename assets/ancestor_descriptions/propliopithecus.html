Propliopithecus is an extinct genus of ape. The 40 cm (1 ft 4 in) long creature resembled today's gibbons. Its eyes faced forwards, giving it stereoscopical vision. Propliopithecus was most likely an omnivore. The fossil record of higher primates in the Old World begins in the Oligocene of Egypt and extend through the Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene of East Africa, Europe, and Asia. If these fossils represent the appearance of small anthropoid apes, they also provide the evident the touring the Miocene they have given rise to a great variety of different types which must have spread far and did over the Old World. And those that reach the Far East in Pliocene probably gave rise to gibbon and orangutan.
