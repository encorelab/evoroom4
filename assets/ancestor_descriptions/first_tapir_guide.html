There are four species of Tapirs: the Brazilian Tapir, the Malayan Tapir, Baird's Tapir and the Mountain Tapir. All four species of tapir are classified as endangered or vulnerable. <span class="guide-text">Their closest relatives are the other odd-toed ungulates, including horses and rhinoceroses</span>.
