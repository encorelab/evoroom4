Pangolins are often called scaly anteaters as they are covered in tough overlapping scales. These scales are made from keratin similar to our fingernails. The scales constantly grow and are worn down when the Pangolin digs through burrows and tunnels. Their underside has no scales but rather is covered with sparse fur, and they can quickly roll into a tight ball for protection. Pangolins have poor vision and so they rely on their sharp sense of smell to locate ants and termites, using their long sticky tongue to eat their prey. Although unknown how long these pangolins can live in the wild, there have been cases where they have lived as long a twenty years in captivity. As solitary mammals, Pangolins are nocturnal and very secretive, making it hard for scientists to study them in their natural habitat. As a result, very little is known about their behavior and habitats.
