Argusianus Argus, is one of the largest pheasants, with the male weighing around 2.5 kg and measuring almost 2 metres, including its tail. The species exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the female duller and smaller. Though not as colourful as other pheasants, these pheasants are noted for their special courtship rituals in which the male makes a clearing to dance in. Great Argus Pheasants are monogamous. Their habitat, the lowland rainforests of Borneo, Sumatra, and some other islands, is being rapidly destroyed. However, since there are still over 100 thousand individuals left in the wild and they live in higher rainforests as well, they are only listed as near threatened.
