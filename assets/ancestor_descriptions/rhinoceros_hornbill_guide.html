Buceros rhinoceros, the rhinoceros hornbill, is one of the largest hornbills and weighs from 2 to 3 kg and is around a metre long. Their diet usually comprises of fruits and nuts, though they often eat insects and small vertebrates as well. They can live up to 30 years of age and usually live in pairs (they are monogamous), though they will often form small groups in tree to eat. Like the malabar grey hornbill, the rhinoceros hornbill finds holes in trees to make their nests in. After, the male uses mud to block the hole and keep the female inside while she incubates her eggs. These birds live in forests (in Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and Malaysia) up to 1400 metres above sea level as well as swamp forest, though they usually inhabit lowland rainforests. Rapid deforestation has caused the total population of this species, which is now classified as near threatened on the IUCN red list, to decline.
