Benjaminâ€™s fig (also known as Ficus benjamina, the weeping fig, or the ficus tree) is a type of fig that grows in Southeast Asia and Australia.  The fig tree grows to heights of up to 30m, with glossy, thick leaves fifteen to thirty-three centimetres long.  The fruit is also edible; however, the figs are not cultivated due to sensitivity to light.

The Curtain Fig (also known as Ficus microcarpa, Chinese Banyan, Malayan Banyan, and Indian Laurel) is a fig tree that inhabits land from the Ryukyu Islands to India, Southeast Asia in between those points, and Australia.   The tree can grow to 18m tall, and are sometimes known as strangler figs, as they can be found growing on (and sometimes killing) another tree.  Like most figs in the area, it has a symbiotic relation with the fig wasp.
