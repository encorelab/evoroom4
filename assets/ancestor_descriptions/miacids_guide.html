Miacids (Miacidae) were <span class="guide-text">primitive carnivores</span> which lived during the late Paleocene and Eocene epochs about 62â€”33 million years ago. Miacids existed for approximately 29 million years.
Miacids are thought to have evolved into today's modern carnivorous mammals of the order Carnivora. They were small carnivores, superficially marten-like or civet-like with long, little bodies and long tails. Some species were arboreal while others lived on the ground.

They probably fed on invertebrates, lizards, birds, and smaller mammals like shrews and opossums. Their teeth and skulls show that the miacids were less developed than modern carnivorans. They had carnivoran-type carnassials but lacked fully ossified auditory bullae (rounded protrusions).
