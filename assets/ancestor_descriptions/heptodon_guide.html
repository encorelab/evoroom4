Heptodon is an <span class="guide-text">extinct genus of tapir-type herbivore</span> of the family Helaletidae endemic to North America during the Eocene epoch. It lived from 55.4â€”48.6 mya, existing for approximately 6.8 million years. Heptodon was about 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length, and closely resembled modern tapirs. The shape of the skull suggests that it probably lacked the characteristic tapir trunk. Instead it probably had a slightly elongated, fleshy upper lip, like its relative Helatetes.
