Ants are a hive based insects of the family Formicidae.  Ants exist in nearly all environments, and live on all major landmasses except Antarctica.  It is estimated that there are around 22 000 different species of ants, and that these ants form between fifteen and twenty five percent of all animal biomass on earth.  Ants form colonies that range dramatically in size, form small predatory groups in natural openings, to colonies that contain millions of individuals.  Ants effectively divide labour, having set social castes for workers, soldiers, and fertile queens.
