The earliest primate found in the fossil record is Purgatorius. It was roughly the size of a rat and fed on insects and soft fruits. These early primates may have shared a common ancestor with rodents. During the Paleocene most primate-like animals belonged to a group called Plesiadapiformes. Traditionally, the plesiadapiforms have been regarded as archaic members of the order Primates. Although plesiadapiforms are similar to modern primates in a number of characteristics of their skeleton, they were still on a much lower evolutionary level, comparable perhaps to the living tree-shrews. Modern primates are unique among mammals in their adaptation to life in the trees. Their capabilities of grasping and leaping allow rapid locomotion in this environment, which is in turn related to the large brain size they have developed. As far as we know, plesiadapiforms also spent most of their time in the trees. However, they lack adaptations for fast leaping as we see them in modern primates and were not capable of moving as quickly through the trees. In addition, their brain was still very small in comparison to modern primates. On the other hand, plesiadapiforms soon acquired traits that are unusual for later primates, especially enlarged incisors that are superficially similar to those of rodents. This suggests that the plesiadapiforms were not the direct ancestors of modern primates, but rather a branch that split off from the mainline of primate evolution (from today's point of view) at an early date.
