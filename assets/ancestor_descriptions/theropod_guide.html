The theropod (meaning "beast-footed") dinosaurs are a diverse group of <span class="guide-text">bipedal saurischian dinosaurs</span>. They include the largest terrestrial carnivores ever to have made the earth tremble. What most people think of as theropods (e.g., T. rex, Deinonychus) are extinct today, but recent studies have conclusively shown that birds are actually the descendants of small nonflying theropods.
