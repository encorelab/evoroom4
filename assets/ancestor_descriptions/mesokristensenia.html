Mesokristensenia is an extinct genus of moth in the family Mesokristenseniidae. It existed in what is now China during the middle Jurassic period. Currently, three species are known. They were discovered in the Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation, Daohugou beds (in Inner Mongolia). The new family could represent the sister group of the Micropterigidae. Mesokristensenia differs from all extant Lepidoptera, but one genus, Agathiphaga (Agathiphagidae), in retaining four median veins in the forewing.
