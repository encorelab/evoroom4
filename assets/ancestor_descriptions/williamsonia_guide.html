The <span class="guide-text">first Australian angiosperm-like plant</span> recorded is Williamsonia, which had cones with a bulbous receptacle, surrounded by bracts forming the "flower". Williamsonia was a bennettitalean species; meaning that it belonged to the group of Bennettales which were like cycads.
