<span class="guide-text">Solitary wasps evolved from vespoid wasps. The first bees probably evolved from the sphecoid wasps</span> around 30 million years ago while honeybees had largely stabilised into their present forms about 27 million years ago. The evolution of bees is closely linked with the development of flowering plants with the insects acting as a pollen transfer vehicle in a relationship which benefits both pollinator and plant. Over the period of their evolution honeybees have moved to a complex social society from solitary and then communal living antecedents.
