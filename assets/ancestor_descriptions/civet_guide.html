Civets are small lithe nocturnal mammals. Whatâ€™s interesting about them is that their feces produce one of the most expensive coffees. They love eating coffee cherries, and after the acid and enzymes in their stomach process these coffee cherries, the final product is the bean without the fruit. These beans are then cleaned before roasted, producing oilier beans, which are tastier according to experts.
