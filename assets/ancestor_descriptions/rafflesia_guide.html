Rafflesia is a genus of parasitic plants that inhabit the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra, Thailand and the Philippines.  The plant does not have a stem, roots, or leaves, but instead spreads its absorptive organ into its host vine.  Because of this the only part that shows is a massive flower, which in some cases may be up to 100cm in diameter.  The flower also produces a rotting smell to attract flies which pollinate it.  This smell has prompted locals to give it the names “corpse flower" and "meat flower “.
