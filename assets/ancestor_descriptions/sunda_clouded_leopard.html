The clouded leopard is named due to the “clouds” on its coat. At first they were considered to be a single species, but has recently split into two different species; the Neofelis nebulosa and the Neofelis diardi. They have a long furry tail, almost as long as their body length, and is marked with black rings. These leopards are well adapted to forest life and due to their stout legs and broad paws, they can easily climb trees and creep through the forest. Interestingly, in proportion to their body size, they have the largest canines of all the big cats.  This may have been due to evolving teeth and jaws that are similar to the saber-toothed cats.
