Ginger is the rhizome root of the plant Zingiber Officinale, which inhabits Southeast Asia, and has been brought to East Africa and the Caribbean for cultivation.  The Zingiber Officinale grows to generally a metre tall and produces clusters of white and pink flower buds that later produce yellow flowers upon blooming.  The ginger, or ginger root, has been used as a spice, medicine and delicacy for millennia by locals of Southeast Asia and more recently by the rest of the world as well.
