The Thecodonts were a diverse group of <span class="guide-text">Triassic reptiles</span> that included small, agile two- and four-legged forms, large four-legged carnivores, armored herbivores, and crocodile-like aquatic reptiles. They gave rise to crocodiles, dinosaurs, and probably flying reptiles (pterosaurs).

The Thecodontia are defined by certain shared primitive or ancestral features, such as the suborbital fenestra (an opening on each side of the skull between the eye sockets and the nostrils) and teeth in sockets. The name Thecodont is actually Latin for “socket-tooth,” referring to the fact that thecodont teeth were set in sockets in the jawbones; an archosaurian characteristic that was inherited by the dinosaurs.

Thecodontia therefore is an evolutionary grade of animals, rather than a clade. They represent a "grab-bag" taxon for any archosaur that wasn't a crocodilian, a pterosaur, or a dinosaur. Most palaeontologists nowadays use the term "basal archosaur" to refer to Thecodonts.

The Thecodontia are generally divided into four suborders, the Proterosuchia, Phytosauria, the Aetosauria, and the Pseudosuchia. However the Pseudosuchia constitute an artificial group, having the same "grab-bag" status within the Thecodontia as the Thecodontia have within the Archosauria.
