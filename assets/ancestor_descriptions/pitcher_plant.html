Pitcher plants are a range of carnivorous plants that feature a deep leaf like cavity in which it digests insects.  Insects, first attracted by nectar or pigments indicating flowers, fall into the trap, and drown, since downward facing hairs and waxy insides prevent them from climbing out. Both monocot and eudicot varieties of the pitcher plant exist, indicating a convergent evolution.  Pitcher plants exist on most major landmasses, including North and South America, Southeast Asia and Asia.
