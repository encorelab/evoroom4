Fig wasps are wasp of the family Agaonidae that pollinate and have a sympathetic relation with figs.  The larvae of the species live in figs; however, females will leave the figs after metamorphosis.  Males however, live in the fig their entire lives, and dig holes in the figs so they can fertilize females.  The females, in the process of flying from one fig to another, pollinate the fig tree, allowing it to bear fruit.  It appears that the symbiotic relation with figs was existed for the past seventy to ninety million years.
