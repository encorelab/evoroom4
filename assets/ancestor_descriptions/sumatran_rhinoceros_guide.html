This two-horned Sumatran rhinoceros is the world’s most endangered rhino. As the smallest of the rhino family, they live in isolated mountain forests in Malaysia and Indonesia. Unlike other rhinos, the Sumatran rhinoceros has sharp senses of smell and hearing, using a trail of scents in the forest to find one another. However they are solitary animals. Also unlike other rhinos, the Sumatran rhino has a dark red-brown hide covered with short stiff hair that helps keep mud on the body, allowing the hide to cool and protecting it from insects. It is thought that less than 400 of these rhinos exist today. Although some of them are kept in zoos, they don’t breed often in captivity, and in 2001, a calf born was the first successful captive delivery in over 100 years. Their main threats are habitat destruction and poaching, as their horns are prized.
