Yanornis is an extinct genus of omnivorous Early Cretaceous birds, thought to be closely related to the common ancestor of all modern birds. The genus name Yanornis is derived from the Ancient Chinese Yan dynasties, whose capital was at Chaoyang, and Ancient Greek ornis, "bird". The species Y. martini was named for avian paleontologist Larry Martin.

It was the size of a chicken, had a long skull with about 10 teeth in the upper jaw and 20 teeth in the lower jaw, and was both able to fly and walk well, having a well-developed U-shaped furcula (wishbone). It ate a varied diet and was capable of switching between major food sources, including fish and seeds, as evidenced by some specimens which preserve large amounts of gastroliths in the stomach. Its fish-eating and associated adaptations shows convergent evolution to the unrelated enantiornithine Longipteryx.
