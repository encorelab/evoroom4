                <div>Welcome to the simulation lab. As part of your training to join a special team of rainforest ecologists to save the rain forest, we've prepared a number of exercises to test your knowledge, problem solving-skills and ability to work in a team-based environment.</div>
                <br />
                <div>Your first task is in the domain of evolution. You will examine the Borneo area between 200 million years ago (mya) and present day. You will work in teams, with each member specializing in different species of the rainforest.</div>
                <br />
                <div>You will be collectively creating a cladogram and determine how the species of Borneo came to be in their current form.</div>
